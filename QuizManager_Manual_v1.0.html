			<p>This section describes how to use Quiz Manager to take quizzes. You will find here a step-by-step guide about how to select a quiz in your file system, choose a quiz mode and how it will behave while your are taking a quiz. <br />
			You will also find what all the items in menu bar at the top of the window do.</p>
			<p>So now, without any further delay, let's get you started with Quiz Manager!</p>
		
			<ol>
				<li>
				<h2 id="QM_firstSteps">Taking your first quiz</h2>
		
				<p>Here are the few steps you need to follow to launch a quiz thanks to Quiz Manager.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
					<h3 id="QM_firstSteps:1">Launching Quiz Manager</h3>
					<p>It could seem obvious but well, you need to launch the software first. Usually a double-click on QuizManager.jar wherever you placed it in your file system should be enough. <br_/>
					If you haven't downloaded the program yet, you can do so by clicking the following <a href="https://github.com/PatFin/QuizManager/blob/master/Jars/QuizManager.jar?raw=true">link</a>.<br />
					The following window should now appear:

				<!-- insert image of the window -->

					<p>If the window doesn't appear, maybe you haven't installed the latest version of Java Runtime Environment (or JRE for short). You can find instructions on how to install JRE on your computer <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html#" target="_blank">here</a>. If after installing JRE and resarting your computer you still don't manage to launch the program then you can try <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=I+can%27t+run+a+jar+file" target="_blank">this</a>. Best of luck! </p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<h3 id="QM_firstSteps:2">Opening a Deck on your file system</h3>			
					<p>You should now have window looking like this <a href="">one</a>. <br /><!--link to image -->
					Now you may wonder what we mean by 'deck'. A deck is the word we use to describe a series of questions and their answer that Quiz Manager is able to handle. In Quiz Manager, each question contains the following information:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A question</li>
						<li>A correct answer</li>
						<li>Three wrong answers</li>
						<li>An explanation</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you would like to create your own decks, I sugggest you directly skip to the <a href="#EDITOR">Deck Editor</a> section. If you would like to try Quiz Manager but you don't want to create a deck yourself, you can download one <a href="">here</a>. <!--Add Random quiz to github -->
					</p>
					<p>To open a deck file located in your files, you need to go into the 'File' menu located at the top left corner of the window. You then need to click on the item labeled as 'Load Deck'.</p>
					<p>As an alternative you can use the following keyboard shortcuts: 
					<ol>
						<li>Alt + F to open the 'File' Menu.</li>
						<li>L (equivalent to clicking on the 'Load Deck' item).
					</ol>
					<p>A file chooser dialog now opens. It should look similar to the one on this image:
					</p>
					<!-- Image of the file chooser -->
					<p>You can now browse your file in search of a deck file. Those files end with a '.dk' extension. You can use the filter of the file chooser to choose to display either all your files or only the folders and the deck files to make the search easier.
					</p>
					<p>
					<em>If you happen to find a dk file on your system that doesn't look like a deck file, it may be used by another program that happens to use the same extension to store data. It is probably safer to avoid trying to open those files with Quiz Manager! But if you like to live dangerously, then it is your problem ;).</em>
					</p>
					</li><!-- End of opening a deck section -->
					<li>
					<h3 id="QM_firstSteps:3">Choosing a Quiz mode</h3>
					<p>This step should be pretty simple, it is about being able to click on a button on the screen. You are probably more interested in the difference between the different choices that appear on your screen:
					</p>
					<!-- Insert image of the choice here -->
					<ul>
						<li>
						<h4 id="QM_firstSteps:31">Learning mode</h4>
						<p>Learning mode is, true to its name, intented for learning purposes. In short, the idea is the following: <em>Bis repetita placent</em>. 
						</p>
						<p>
						When you answer a question with the good answer, the buttons on which the possible answers were displayed switches to a congratulation message. You can then process to the next question by clicking the button just below. <br />
						However, if you provide a wrong answer, the answer buttons will be replaced by the exaplanation. And you can then proceed to the next question by clicking on the button just below. 
						</p>
						<p>And so you would think that you woul just go through all the questions until the deck runs out of question? Well ... not quite. <em>The question will keep reappearing</em> until you provide enough correct answers. This 'enough correct answers' amount can be changed by following <a href="#QM_Menubar:3">these</a> instructions. <!-- Add link to change settings -->
						</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<h4 id="QM_firstSteps:32">Test mode</h4>
						<p>The test mode is a bit more trivial than the <em>Learning Mode</em>. 
						</p>
						<p>All the questions of the deck will be displayed <em>only once</em>. As soon as you answer a question, the next one is displayed, until the decks runs out of questions.<em> Unlike the learning mode, no explanation is displayed between two questions.</em> A message will then be displayed with your score indicated as follows:
						</p>
						<!-- Insert image of the result -->
						<p>In the example above, 'XX/TT' means the user got XX good answers out of TT questions.
						</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					</li><!-- End of Choosing a quiz mode section -->
					<li><h3 id="QM_firstStep:4">During the Quiz</h3>
					<p>You will encounter two kinds of display during a quiz when using Quiz Manager. The question display and the explanation display.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><h4 id="QM_firstStep:41">Question</h4>
						<p>When a question is presented to the user, it is displayed like this:
						</p>
						<!--Insert question image -->
						<p>At the top you have the question. It here reads 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX'. <br />
						Below are four buttons that each contain a possible answer to the question. The software is programmed such that <em>the position of the good answer changes from a question to another</em>, so it is basically useless to always click on the same button! <br />
						And then just below you have a 'I don't know' button. Clicking on this button will have the same effect as providing a wrong answer. Hence if you click on this button in <a href="#QM_firstSteps:31">learning mode</a>, it will then display the explanation.
						</p>
						</li>
						<li><h4>Explanation (specific to the learning mode)</h4>
						<p><em>You will only see the explanation view when running a quiz in learning mode</em>. For more detailed information, you can refer to <a href="#QM_firstSteps:3">this</a> section.
						</p>
						<p>When taking a quiz in learning mode, after each answer you provide, you will end up with a display like this one:
						</p>
						<!--Insert image of explanation here -->
						<p>You can see the question you just answered to is still displayed. But just below it, the answer buttons have been replaced by a text area. The content of this text area will vary, depending on if you provided a right or a wrong answer to the question. 
						</p>
						<p>
						If you were right, the text area will contain a congratulation message. <br />
						If you were wrong, the text area will contain the explanation associated with the question. Hopefully, the creator of the deck will have provided sufficient explanation for you to get a good answer next time!
						</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

				<li>
				<h2 id="QM_Menubar">The menus in the MenuBar</h2>
				<!-- There are a lot of things to write here :D -->
				<p>The menu bar located at the top of the window contains the following items:
				<ul>
					<li id="QM_Menubar:1">File
					<p>So far there is only one item in this menu: <em>Load Deck</em>. Its use is already detailed <a href="#QM_firstSteps:2">here</a>.
					</p>
					</li>
					<li id="QM_Menubar:2">Edit
					<p>The Edit menu contains two items: 
					<ul>
						<li>Create deck</li>
						<li>Edit deck</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Both of these items will open a Quiz Editor window. The Create Deck item will directly launch a new Editor Window whereas the Edit deck will first open a file chooser dialog to allow you to open an existing deck file into the editor. For more details about the editor, you can refer to the <a href="#EDITOR">Editor</a> section of this manual.
					</p>
					</li>
					<li id="QM_Menubar:3">Preferences
					<p>The preference menu contain a single item: <em>Options</em>. By clicking on this item you will open a dialog asking for the 'Number of good answers to pass a question in Learning mode'. The current value is then indicated in a text field. 
					</p>
					<p>As indicated, this dialog let you choose how many times you need to provide a good answer to a question for it not to appear again in learning mode. For more details about the way the learning mode works, you can go <a href="#QM_firstSteps:31">here</a>.
					</p>
					</li>
					<li id="QM_Menubar:4">About
					<p>The About menu contains a single item: <em>Credits</em>. Clicking on it will open a new window containing various information about what you can and cannot do with this software. It also contains a copy of the GNU General Public License under which this software is published. </p>
					<p>In a further version there will also be an item to open this user manual in your favorite web browser.
