			<p>This section describes how to use Quiz Manager to take quizzes. You will find here a step-by-step guide about how to select a quiz in your file system, choose a quiz mode and how it will behave while your are taking a quiz. <br />
			You will also find what all the items in menu bar at the top of the window do.</p>
			<p>So now, without any further delay, let's get you started with Quiz Manager!</p>
		
			<ol>
				<li>
				<h2 id="QM_firstSteps">Taking your first quiz</h2>
		
				<p>Here are the few steps you need to follow to launch a quiz thanks to Quiz Manager.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
					<h3 id="QM_firstSteps:1">Launching Quiz Manager</h3>
					<p>It could seem obvious but well, you need to launch the software first. Usually a double-click on QuizManager.jar wherever you placed it in your file system should be enough. <br_/>
					If you haven't downloaded the program yet, you can do so by clicking the following <a href="https://github.com/PatFin/QuizManager/blob/master/Jars/QuizManager.jar?raw=true">link</a>.<br />
					The following window should now appear:

				<!-- insert image of the window -->

					<p>If the window doesn't appear, maybe you haven't installed the latest version of Java Runtime Environment (or JRE for short). You can find instructions on how to install JRE on your computer <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html#" target="_blank">here</a>. If after installing JRE and resarting your computer you still don't manage to launch the program then you can try <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=I+can%27t+run+a+jar+file" target="_blank">this</a>. Best of luck! </p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<h3 id="QM_firstSteps:2">Opening a Deck on your file system</h3>			
					<p>You should now have window looking like this one. </p>
					<!--link to image -->
					<p>Now you may wonder what we mean by 'Deck'. A Deck is the word we use to describe a series of questions and their answers which Quiz Manager is able to handle. In Quiz Manager, each question contains the following information:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A question</li>
						<li>A correct answer</li>
						<li>Three wrong answers</li>
						<li>An explanation</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you want to create your own decks, I sugggest you directly skip to the <a href="#EDITOR">Deck Editor</a> section. If you would like to try Quiz Manager but you don't want to create a deck yourself, you can <a href="https://github.com/PatFin/QuizManager/raw/master/Downloads/Deck%20Example.zip">download one here</a>.</p>
					
					<p>To open a deck file located in your files, you need to go into the 'File' menu located at the top left corner of the window. You then need to click on the item labeled as 'Load Deck'.</p>
					<p>As an alternative you can use the following keyboard shortcuts: 
					<ol>
						<li>Alt + F to open the 'File' Menu.</li>
						<li>L (equivalent to clicking on the 'Load Deck' item).
					</ol>
					<p>A file chooser dialog now opens. It should look like this:
					</p>
					<!-- Image of the file chooser -->
					<p>You can now browse your file in search of a deck file. Those files end with a '.dk' extension. You can use the filter of the file chooser to choose to display either all your files or only the folders and the deck files to make the search easier.
					</p>
					<p>
					<em>If you happen to find a dk file on your system that doesn't look like a deck file, it may be used by another program that happens to use the same extension to store data. It is probably safer to avoid trying to open those files with Quiz Manager! But if you like to live dangerously, then it is your problem ;).</em>
					</p>
					</li><!-- End of opening a deck section -->
					<li>
					<h3 id="QM_firstSteps:3">Choosing a Quiz mode</h3>
					<p>This step should be pretty simple, it is about being able to click on a button on the screen. You are probably more interested in the difference between the different choices that appear on your screen:
					</p>
					<!-- Insert image of the choice here -->
					<ul>
						<li>
						<h4 id="QM_firstSteps:31">Learning mode</h4>
						<p>Learning mode is, true to its name, intented for learning purposes. In short, the idea is the following: <em>Bis repetita placent</em>. 
						</p>
						<p>
						When you answer a question with the good answer, the buttons on which the possible answers were displayed switches to a congratulation message. You can then process to the next question by clicking the button just below. <br />
						However, if you provide a wrong answer, the answer buttons will be replaced by the exaplanation. And you can then proceed to the next question by clicking on the button just below. 
						</p>
						<p>And so you would think that you woul just go through all the questions until the deck runs out of question? Well ... not quite. </p>
						<p><em>The question will keep reappearing until you provide enough correct answers.</em> This 'enough correct answers' amount can be changed by following <a href="#QM_Menubar:3">these</a> instructions. </p>
						
						</li>
						<li>
						<h4 id="QM_firstSteps:32">Test mode</h4>
						<p>The test mode is a bit more trivial than the <em>Learning Mode</em>. 
						</p>
						<p>All the questions of the deck will be displayed <em>only once</em>. As soon as you answer a question, the next one is displayed, until the decks runs out of questions.<em> Unlike the learning mode, no explanation is displayed between two questions.</em> A message will then be displayed with your score indicated as follows:
						</p>
						<!-- Insert image of the result -->
						<p>In the example above, 'XX/TT' means the user got XX good answers out of TT questions.
						</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					</li><!-- End of Choosing a quiz mode section -->
					<li><h3 id="QM_firstSteps:4">During the Quiz</h3>
					<p>You will encounter two kinds of display during a quiz when using Quiz Manager. The <em>question display</em> and the <em>explanation display</em>.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><h4 id="QM_firstStep:41">Question</h4>
						<p>When a question is presented to the user, it is displayed like this:
						</p>
						<!--Insert question image -->
						<p>At the top you have the question. It here reads 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX'. <br />
						Below are four buttons that each contain a possible answer to the question. The software is programmed such that <em>the position of the good answer changes from a question to another</em>. So always clicking on the same button is basically useless! </p>
						<p>And then just below you have a 'I don't know' button. Clicking on this button will have the same effect as providing a wrong answer. Hence if you click on this button in <a href="#QM_firstSteps:31">learning mode</a>, it will display the explanation.
						</p>
						</li>
						<li><h4>Explanation (specific to the learning mode)</h4>
						<p><em>You will only see the explanation view when running a quiz in learning mode</em>. <br /> 
						For more detailed information, you can refer to <a href="#QM_firstSteps:3">this section</a>.</p>
						<p>When taking a quiz in learning mode, after each answer you provide, you will end up with a display like this one:
						</p>
						<!--Insert image of explanation here -->
						<p>You can see the question you just answered to is still displayed. But just below it, the answer buttons have been replaced by a text area. The content of this text area will vary, depending on if you provided a right or a wrong answer to the question. 
						</p>
						<p>If you were right, the text area will contain a congratulation message. <p>
						<p>If you were wrong, the text area will contain the explanation associated with the question. Hopefully, the creator of the deck will have provided sufficient explanation for you to get a good answer next time!</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					</li><!-- End of during the quiz section -->

				</li><!-- End of first steps section-->
				<li>
				<h2 id="QM_Menubar">The menus in the MenuBar</h2>
				<!-- There are a lot of things to write here :D -->
				<p>The menu bar located at the top of the window contains the following items:
				<ul>
					<li id="QM_Menubar:1">File
					<p>So far there is only one item in this menu: <em>Load Deck</em>. Its use is already detailed <a href="#QM_firstSteps:2">here</a>.
					</p>
					</li>
					<li id="QM_Menubar:2">Edit
					<p>The Edit menu contains two items: 
					<ul>
						<li>Create deck</li>
						<li>Edit deck</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Both of these items will open a <a href="#EDITOR">Quiz Editor</a> window. </p>
					<p>The Create Deck item will directly launch a new Editor Window whereas the Edit deck will first open a file chooser dialog to allow you to open an existing deck file into the editor. </p>
					</li>
					<li id="QM_Menubar:3">Preferences
					<p>The preference menu contain a single item: <em>Options</em>. By clicking on this item you will open a dialog asking for the 'Number of good answers to pass a question in Learning mode'. The current value is then indicated in a text field. 
					</p>
					<p>As indicated, this dialog lets you choose how many times you need to provide a good answer to a question for it not to appear again in learning mode. For more details about the way the learning mode works, you can <a href="#QM_firstSteps:31">go to learning mode</a> section.</p>
					</li>
					<li id="QM_Menubar:4">About
					<p>The About menu contains two items: <em>Credits</em> and <em>User Manual</em>. </p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Clicking on <em>Credit</em> will open a new window containing various information about what you can and cannot do with this software. It also contains a copy of the GNU General Public License under which this software is published. </p>
						</li>
						<li><p>Clicking on <em>User Manual</em> will open this manual in your web browser.</p></li>

			<p></p>
			<ol>
				<li>
				<h2 id="firstdeck">Creating your first Deck</h2>
				<p>You will learn here the few but simple steps to follow to create a deck.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li><h3 id="firstdeck:1">Opening the Deck Editor</h3>
					<p>First, you will need to open the Deck Editor. In the window that opens when you launch QuizManager.jar, click on the Edit menu (it is located next to the File menu). Two items now appear:</p>
					<!-- Insert image here -->
					<p>Click on the Create Deck item. A new window should appear with the following appearance:
					</p>
					<!-- Insert Image here -->
					</li><!-- End of opening editor -->
					
					<li><h3 id="firstdeck:2">Creating your questions</h3>
					<p>You can see at the top of the window, your question number is displayed. As you are creating a new deck, it should display 'Card 1'. Below are 6 empty fields, each matching a Label. </p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>The first field will contain <em>the question</em>. You can enter it by clicking on it and typing your question.</p>
						</li>
						<li><p>The second field will contain <em>the correct answer</em>. Try not to mess it up. There is no artificial intelligence checking that what you claim to be the answer to that question is really a good answer. If you screw it up, those who will then use the quiz are going to be confused!</p>
						</li>
						<li><p>The three following fields are meant to receive <em>the wrong answers</em>. Again try not to put a good answer in one of those field or you will confuse those who will take the quiz after you! </p>
						</li>
						<li><p>The last field is a bit larger and is meant to welcome <em>the explanation</em>to the question. Not that unlike all the other fields you can type on <em>several lines</em>. If you are typing a rather long explanation, do not hesitate to resize the window to display more text! </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>And that's it! You have created your first question! Now you would ask: </p> 
					<p><em>How do I create the next question? </em></p>
					<p>Well it is <em>very simple</em>. At the bottom of the window are two buttons: <em>Prev</em> and <em>Next</em>. <br />
					Clicking on the Next button will open a new question form and you will be able to fill in the fields just like you just did for your first question! Notice that the card number indicated at the top of the window changes as you press the 'Next' button.</p>
					<p>If you want to change a question you wrote, click on the 'Prev' button. The text you entered will now appear again and you will be able to modify it. </p>
					<p>If you can't click on the 'Prev' button, it means you already are on the first question, and so, as there are no previous question to the first one, you can't go back.</p>
					
					<h4 id="firstdeck:21">Warning</h4>
					<p><em>If you do not fill in some of the fields in a question, the program will still work properly and you will be able to save your deck normally. </em></p>
					<p><strong>But!</strong><em> When you will take a quiz using this deck with empty entries, nothing will be displayed where the empty field was empty in the editor. This might confuse the user. Hence, unless this is your goal, I recommend that you always fill in all the fields whan you create a question.</em></p>
					</li><!--End of creating questions section -->
					<li><h3 id="firstdeck:3">Saving you Deck</h3>
					<p>You have created a bunch of questions (or maybe just one) and you would like to save the deck you've just created in your file system. Doing so is very simple. Here is what you need to do.</p>
					<p>Click on the file menu in the menu bar at the top of the window. Then click on 'Save Deck'. A file chooser dialog like this one should now appear.</p>
					<!-- Inseert image here -->
					<p>You can now explore your folders to find a suitable location for your Deck. Maybe you want to create a new folder that will contain all of them, it's up to personal taste.</p>
					<h4 id="firstdeck:31">Warning!</h4>
					<p><em>Whichever name you give to your deck, <strong>please make sure you specified the extension of your file</strong> which should be <strong>.dk</strong>. If you don't save your deck with this format, you will not be able to open it, would you want to play the quiz or edit it.
					</em></p>
					<p><em>In the unlikely event where you were to <strong>find a file</strong> whose extension is .dk <strong>but you don't think is a quiz</strong> you created or downloaded, <strong>do not re-write it!</strong> It may be a file from another program, and erasing it may cause errors in this other software. 
					</em></p>
					<p>As far as I know, no program uses the .dk extension but do not take this for granted! If you are aware or if you know a program uses this extension, please share the information by <a href="mailto:finnertypatri@aol.fr" target="_blank">sending me an e-mail</a>. Thank you!</p>
					<p>You can either select an existing file and re-write it. <em>Be careful! You will forever loose the data contained in the file you selected!</em></p>
					</li><!-- End of Saving your deck -->
				</ol><!-- End of creating your first deck -->
				<li><h2 id="edit">Editing an existing deck</h2>
				<p>Here is how you can open an existing deck file to edit it.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><h3 id="edit:1">From the Editor</h3></a>
					<p>In the menu bar at the top of the window, click on the File menu and then on the 'Open Deck' item. This will open a file chooser dialog to let you choose which file you want to open. Once you have chosen the file you wish to open, the first question of the deck will appear in the window. You can now change the questions as explained <a href="#firsdeck:2">above</a>.
					<!-- put image here -->
					</p>
					</li>
					<li><h3 id="edit:2">From the Player window</h3>
					<p>In the menu bar at the top of the window, click on the Edit menu and then on the 'Edit Deck' item. This will open a file chooser dialog that will let you choose which deck you wish to edit. After you have chosen a file, a new Editor window will appear with the deck you selected. Even if you didn't choose any deck, the Editor window will appear but with empty fields. </p>
					<p>You can then follow the steps described <a href="#firsdeck:2">above</a>.
					</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				</li><!--End of editing existing deck -->
				<li><h2 id="menubar">The Editor Menu Bar items</h2>
				<p>There are only two menus in the Editor. File and Edit.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><h3 id="menubar:1">The File menu</h3>
					<!-- Insert image here -->
					<h4 id="menubar:11">Warning!</h4>
					<p><em>Using any of the File menu item </em>(exept the Save File item)<em> will make you loose all the content you already have in the Editor. All the questions fields you were working on will be cleared without warning. Please <strong>make sure you saved</strong> what you want to keep <strong>before</strong> you press one of these buttons!
					</em></p>
					<ul>
						<li><h5>New Deck</h5>
						<p>The 'New Deck' item will entirely clear all the fields of the current Deck you are working on. <em>Beware, every question you typed which you haven't saved beforehand will be lost!</em>
						</p>
						</li>
						<li><h5>Open Deck</h5>
						<p>The 'Open Deck' item will let you open an existing deck in the Editor. You will then be available to change the questions, add some etc. <em>Beware! If you made changes to a deck but didn't save it, and open another deck, all those changes will be lost without warning! Make sure you saved your previous deck before opening an other one! </em>
						</p>
						</li>
						<li><h5>Save Deck</h5>
						<p>The 'Save Deck' item will open a file chooser dialog to let you save the current content of the Editor. You can refer to the <a href⁼"#firstdeck:3">Save your Deck section</a> above. <em>Make sure you read the <strong>Warning</strong>, it will avoid you getting into trouble!</em>
						</li>
					</ul><!-- End of the list of items of file menu -->
					</li><!-- End of file menu description-->
					<li><h3 id="menubar:2">The Edit menu</h3>
					<p>The Edit menu contains two items, <em>Insert question</em> and <em>Remove question</em>.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><h5>Insert question</h5>
						<p>True to its name, the 'Insert question' item will let you insert a question where you are. </p>
						<p>More accurately, it will push the current question to the next position and create an empty question in the gap. If you press the 'Next' button, you will reach the question you were looking at just before. </p>
						</li>
						<li><h5>Remove question</h5>
						<p>True to its name, this item will remove the question you are currently looking at. </p>
						<p>If there exists a question after the one you just removed, this next question will be displayed. If not, that is you removed the last question of your deck, the previous (and new last) question will be displayed. </p>
						<p>Finally if your deck contains a single question, it will be cleared. </p>
						<p><strong>Beware!</strong> <em>The question you've just removed will be lost forever. You won't be able to find it again!</em>
						</p>
						<p><strong>Note:</strong> if your goal is to remove all the questions currently in your Editor, it will be much quicker to <a href="#menubar:1">use the File > New Deck</a> item!</p>
